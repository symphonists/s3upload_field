# Field: Amazon S3 File Upload

- Version: 0.7
- Author: Symphonists
- Build Date: 2013-08-13
- Requirements: Symphony 2.3.1 or higher

## Origin

This extension is a variation of the 'Unique File Upload Field' extension by Michael Eichelsdoerfer and the Akismet extension (for System Preferences) by  Alistair Kerney. It uses the Amazon S3 PHP class written by Donovan Schonknecht, http://undesigned.org.za/2007/10/22/amazon-s3-php-class. This extension was started by Brian Zerangue, taken over by Andrew Shooner, and some slight modifications to get it working with Symphony 2.2 were made by Scott Tesoriere.


## Overview
This extension functions as a basic replacement for file uploads, allowing hosting on Amazon S3 (it requires an [Amazon S3 account](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)). Uploaded files are world readable. It is not considered feature-complete; there is much additional functionality that could be added . If you have input, please contact us at the Symphony forum, at getsymphony.com. 


## Installation

1. Upload the 's3upload_field' folder in this archive to your Symphony 
   'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Amazon S3 Upload", choose Enable from 
   the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. Under Preferences, add your S3 Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

3. You can now add the "Amazon S3 File Upload" field to your sections. Select the bucket you wish to store files in from the dropdown.

## To do

- If the CNAME is removed or added, update all the files and fields so it has or doesn't have the CNAME, otherwise it will be kind of wonky
- Proper error checking, there are still a few uncaught exceptions.
